# The Hunt3rs

Welcome to the future of networking in conferences and exhibitions: The Hunt3rs app. This innovative, web3 backed networking application is revolutionizing the way brands and attendees engage, connect, and maximize presence in professional gatherings.

# Problems Addressed:

The Hunt3rs app transforms conferences and exhibitions into interactive, gamified experiences, making it more than just an app – it's a digital compass for treasure hunting in the professional world. Attendees interact with booths and speakers as adventure spots, claiming digital tokens, minting NFT badges, and exchanging valuable contacts, all while immersed in an exhilarating hunt.

# How It Works:

- Scout: Review the list of available partners – your targets.
- Track: Find the partners at the event.

- Capture: Complete tasks to claim your badge.
- Gather: Accumulate badges to earn rewards.
- This competitive yet collaborative approach breaks down barriers and encourages fun, engaging interactions.

# Tokenized Experience:

Upon interaction, users (Hunters) instantly receive collectible NFTs and Soulbound Tokens (SBTs).
Brands gather user data (name, wallet ID, email) for effective connection tracking.
